            My interests in Computer Science started during the covid time when
            all schools switched to online overnight. I was a teacher back that
            time and I witnessed the power of technology in education. Suddenly,
            teachers have to be masters of technology of sorts to continue
            eligibility to teach, and those tech tools achieved great results
            with minimum of effort compared with traditional pen and paper way
            of teaching.I was amazed how internet changed the way people meet
            and work and I began to learn the basics of computer science and
            programming during my spare time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took several graduate level online courses and my interests
             grew stronger. I found myself having great pleasure solving problems
              and learning new things in the tech field. I feel like a fish back to 
              the ocean when exploring the tech field. If you are new to programming 
              and would like to start to build some foundation yourself, I strongly
               recommend you to use the resources that I shared at the end of the article.
               I also shared some open courses that I enjoy and find extremely helpful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I left education and fully devoted myself to programming Novemebr 2022. I joined a
            full stack Java developer bootcamp and began practice building
            application both front end and back end. I learned Spring and Spring Boot frameworks, Git and Linux, 
            and Agile/Scrum Methodology and used the knowledge I learned to build web applications. I know my path 
            to master-level engineer just began but I can proudly say that I'm learning and growing every day.
